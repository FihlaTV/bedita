                        INSTALLING BEdita
                          A Quick Howto
               ======================================

$Id$

BEdita is in strong and constant development and does not have a stable version yet, 
altough the alpha version is pretty usable. There is not an automatic setup/install procedure 
with a graphical user interface, but you have to follow some easy steps.
Before installing BEdita

First it is necessary that some preliminary requirements are satisfied. 
You will need a system with:

    * PHP 5.2 or newer with modules gd, mbstring, gettext (recommended)
    * MySQL 5.0.26 or newr version with Stored Procedures support
    * Apache 2
    * shell access

That's it: all third party libraries needed by BEdita are bundled in the source package.
Download BEdita package

If your system does support the requirements listed above you can download the package. 
This package contains everything you need to setup and use BEdita.

In particular you will find inside, the real BEdita application (bedita-app directory), 
the SQL scripts needed to create tables/views and stored procedures (bedita-db dir), 
the CakePHP framework (cake folder), the template engine Smarty (vendors/smarty dir) 
and the phpThumb library (vendors/phpThumb dir).
Intallation

Now we can proceed to the real setup! Just copy the bedita directory (the content of the 
compressed source package) in a directory served by the web server. Now you have just two 
simple thigs to do:

1. Create the database

Just create an empty database on MySQL and define a mysql user having grants on data 
(INSERT, DELETE, etc....) and on structure (CREATE, DROP, etc....)

2. Launch the shell script bedita init

To initialize the system correctly, BEdita has a PHP script that you have to launch 
from the command line (a cake shell script, more precisely). Just go to the bedita 
directory above on the shell and type:

./cake.sh bedita init

The script first checks your configuration, if it finds something wrong or not properly 
setup it will suggest you what to do. For instance if the database connection fails it 
will tell you variable in wich file to check and edit.

HINT: edit $default array in bedita-app/config/database.php, have a look to cakePHP 
documentation.

Don't worry!

There are just two files to edit, bedita-app/config/database.php for the database 
connection (look at the CakePHP docs) and bedita-app/config/bedita.cfg.php where you
 have to define two fundamental variables for BEdita.

    * the first one is $config['mediaRoot'] that indicates a directory on your filesystem 
    where BEdita will put any file uploaded (through a form) on the syste. Veirfy that 
    the webserver has the right permissions to read and write in this directory.
    * the second is $config['mediaUrl'] that indicates the base URL from wich you can 
    reach the uploaded files.

The simplest place where you can create such a directory is inside bedita-app/webroot. 
Suppose you have created there a media directory the above variables will look like these:

$config['mediaRoot'] = "path_to_bedita_".DS."bedita-app".DS."webroot".DS."media";

$config['mediaUrl'] = "http://www.example.com/bedita/media";

DS stands for the generic directory separator that will be "/" for *nix systems 
(Linux, McOSX,...) ot "\" for Windows systems.

 You can obviously have more complex configurations creating the media directory 
 somewhere else defining a virtual host that points to it (recommended for production systems).

Once the system is correclty configured the script wil create and initialize the database. 
At last it will ask if you want to check the status of BEdita, just press y and you will 
receive a short summary of your configuration.

Be aware of the permissions on bedita-app/tmp directory that has to be recursively writable 
from your webserver.
And now?

Open your browser and write on the address bar the location that points to your BEdita 
installation,

You will redirected to the login page! Type bedita as username and also as password
 et voil√†...have fun with BEdita!!
