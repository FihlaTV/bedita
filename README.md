BEdita is a software to create, manage content and organize it with semantic rules.
BEdita is a modular framework that features a back-end Content Management System out-of-the-box.
It is an integrated environment that inherits all the features of the libraries and tools it includes,
like [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/), [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/).

BEdita is flexible and may fit many projects thanks to its MVC / Object Oriented design,
its multi-tier architecture and through the abstraction of semantic relations.
