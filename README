               BEdita, a semantic content management framework 
               ===============================================


      Overview
      ========

      BEdita is a software to create, manage content and organize it with semantic rules.

      BEdita is a modular framework that features a back-end Content Management System out-of-the-box.

      It is an integrated environment that inherits all the features of the libraries and tools it includes,
      like CakePHP, JQuery and Smarty.

      BEdita is flexible and may fit many projects thanks to its MVC / Object Oriented design,
      its multi-tier architecture and through the abstraction of semantic relations.
